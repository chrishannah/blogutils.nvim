This plugin provides some help functions for writing blog posts, such as
formatting text, and generating frontmatter.

Note: all text formatting relies on the utility `textcase` being installed.
You can find that at: https://github.com/chrishannah/textcase-cli

                                                     *blogutils.formatTitle()*
blogutils.formatTitle({input})

    Uses `textcase` to format the given {input} into AP title case.

    >
        blogutils.formatTitle("this is a title")
<

                                                        *blogutils.formatSlug()*
blogutils.formatSlug({input})

    Uses `textcase` to format the given {input} into a hyphen-separated slug.

    >
        blogutils.formatTitle("this is a title")
<

                                             *blogutils.generateFrontMatter()*
blogutils.generateFrontMatter()

    Treats the first line of the current buffer as the input text used for the
    title, which it then uses with `textcase` to generate a title and slug,
    along with the current date to insert YAML frontmatter at the start of the
    current buffer.

    If there is no text to use as the title, the title field will be omitted,
    and the slug will be derived from the current date and time.
